    <p>EU expenditure that can be allocated to individual EU countries.
   Non-allocated expenditure concerns, in particular, expenditure paid

    <div class="glossaryTerm">
      <h3>annual activity reports</h3>
    <p>AARs indicate the results of operations by reference to
objectives    set, associated risks and the form of internal control.
Since the 2001 budget    exercise for the Commission and since 2003 for
all Community institutions,    the ‘authorising officer by delegation’
must submit an AAR to his/her    institution on the performance of
his/her duties, together with financial and    management information.</p>

    <div class="glossaryTerm">
      <h3>appropriations</h3>
    <p>Budget funding. The budget forecasts:
      </p><ul type="disc">
        <li>commitments:         legal pledges to provide finance, provided that certain conditions are         fulfilled.</li>
        <li>payments:         cash or bank transfers to the beneficiaries.</li>
        <li>differentiated         appropriations: appropriations for
commitments and payments often differ         because multiannual
programmes and projects are usually committed in the         year they
are decided and are paid over the years as the implementation         of
 the programme and project progresses. Thus, if the EU budget
increases, due for example to enlargement, commitments will increase
     before payments do. Not all projects and programmes are concluded,
and         appropriations for payments are therefore lower than for
commitments. </li>
        <li>non-differentiated         appropriations: apply for
administrative expenditure, for agricultural         market support and
direct payments. Furthermore, not all projects and         programmes
are concluded, and appropriations for payments are therefore
lower than for commitments.</li>

institution    determines the scope of the internal auditors’ mission

audit function, with due regard    for international internal audit
standards.</p>
    <p>
      External auditor: for the EU institutions, this is the European Court    of Auditors.</p>
    <p>Internal audit: audit performed by a body’s staff rather than an
   independent certified public accountant; the internal auditor (IA)
function    is separate from that of authorising officer and accounting
officer. The IA    is designated by the institution, which it must
advise on how to deal with    risks; it issues independent opinions on
the quality of management and    control systems, and recommends
improvements.</p>

      <h3>balance of payments</h3>
    <p>A balance of payments (BoP) is a document that summarises the
economic    transactions of a country with the rest of the world during a
 particular    period of time. The economic transactions involve goods,
services and income.    Any transaction that makes money to flow into a
country is a credit to its    BoP account, while any transaction that
makes money to flow out of a country    is a debit. Transactions are
operated by individuals, businesses and    government agencies in that
country and those in the rest of the world.</p>

      <h3>budgetary balances</h3>
    <p>The difference between what a country receives from and pays into the    EU budget.</p>
      <p>There are many possible methods of calculating budgetary
balances. In    its annual report on allocated expenditure, the
Commission uses a method    based on the same principles as the
calculation of the correction of    budgetary imbalances granted to the
United Kingdom (the UK rebate).</p>
      <p>  It is, however, important to point out that constructing
estimates of    budgetary balances is merely an accounting exercise of
the purely financial    costs and benefits that each Member State
derives from the Union and it gives    no indication of many of the
other benefits gained from EU policies such as    those relating to the
internal market and economic integration, not to mention    political
stability and security.</p>
