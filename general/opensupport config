Support OCTOGONE-IT.be - 

Note: i use the french language with i-opensupport

in the database what are the mail template "USER_SYSTEM_DISABLED" and "USER_SYSTEM_ENABLED"? 
Are those mail send when a user is created in the admin interface by an administrator and send to the user if he created or deleted? 
i am asking that because i've made some test and i dont receive those type of mail template is that case. 
When i create a user with the admin interface i receieve the mail template "USER_SIGNUP". that s a problem because that new user cant know his password. when i delete a user with the admin interface nomail is send.

the template "TICKET_CREATED" is a confirmation mail  for the user who create the ticket, but in that case user dont receive that confirmation mail.

admin receive no notification when a user close the ticket

no mail template when reopening a ticket

no notification when a user is deleted, banned, desactivated or reactivated.
