    Layout in CSS2 and CSS2.1
        CSS2.1 introduced and defined four different layout modes for rendering web pages. These are systems the
        browser uses when parsing CSS rules to determine the size and position of elements based on their siblings,
        flow in the document, and parent elements. These four modes are as follows:
        • Block layout : For laying out or organizing elements within a document
        • Inline layout : For laying out text
        • Table layout : For presenting and laying out tabular data in a two-dimensional grid
        • Positioned layout : For explicitly positioning elements on the page, removing them
            from the document flow
    Several different positioning attribute values are available as part of the CSS2.1 specification:
            • Static : The normal flow rules apply, and the top , bottom , left , and right properties
            have no effect.
            • Relative : The box’s position is determined according to its position within the
            document flow. Attributes then offset the box’s position relative to its “normal”
            position. Subsequent elements affected by the box’s place in the document flow act
            as if there is no offset on the box.
            • Absolute : The box’s position (and possibly size) is specified with the top , left ,
            bottom , and right properties. These properties specify offsets from the containing
            box (which may be the page itself ).
            • Fixed : The box is positioned as per absolute, but it’s fixed in a position relative to
            some reference. In most cases, the position is fixed relativ

    CSS Level 3 is different than the previous iterations in that it’s modular . This allows the CSS Working
    Group to release different parts of the specification as they mature, and browser vendors are able to adopt
    functionality rapidly. The CSS Level 3 modular approach is broadly split into four elements :
    • Selectors and logic
    • Decorative effects
    • Typography (including support for internationalization)
    • Layout
    CSS Layout Modules
        CSS Level 3 adds a range of new layout tools to the designer’s arsenal. Each of these modules provides an
        exciting approach to crafting layouts using only CSS. The modules will change the way you author your styles
        and, crucially, your HTML markup.
        Rather than a single approach to crafting layout, four principal modules are in development. Each
        includes its own concepts, rules, and, most important, browser support. The following chapters look in
        depth at each of these modules:
        • CSS Multi-column Layout module
        • CSS Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox) module
        • CSS Grid Layout module
        • CSS Regions Layout module
